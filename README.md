# NinetyNine

## Goals:
The purpose of this project is to make a simple muliplayer game so that I can gain some experience with networking. Many games today have multiplayer aspects to them so it only makes sense that I do something that falls into that category as well.

-  The actual game is 'Ninety Nine', a simple card game that my dad is **very** enthusiastic about it.
-  By doing this with a card game I won't have to worry too much about latency
-  I will be using Photon's free services to get simple matchmaking done without having to worry too much about the backend.
   -  Connect to other players in the same region
   -  See changes on the board with minimal latency (we'll see how much control I have over that)
   -  See how much of the logic I can really take care of on the frontend
